# Pipelines
The following are the four folders:
- ./compare_cosine_sim: calculates cosine similarity and metric scoring for sentence encoders on test dataset
- ./finetuning_sentence_encoder: sets up training and testing data, as well as code for training models
- ./generate_dataset: generates the training and test data, by creating PDDL problem files and their NL equivalent
- ./setup_sentence_encoder: sets up the sentence encoders
